Now the Database has been hosted at SiteGround. So, any update in the database will be reflected directly anywhere wherever this website is running. 

Here also, there are many other users which we can help with the SQL Workbench with following creds:
        
        host: '35.213.189.162',
        user: 'staisaho_pink',
        password: 'dbmsproject2020', 
        database: 'staisaho_dbmsproject'

There is already some dummy data being feeded there. 

If you want to check the working of the website, refer to the document sent in attachment alongside.
